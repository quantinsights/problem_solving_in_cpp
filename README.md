# Problem Solving in C++

> The real prize is the pleasure of finding things out, the kick in the discovery, the observation that other people use it. Those are the real things!

*Richard Feynman*

This is a small collection of routines and algorithms to solve selected problems in science and mathematics. The best way to learn anything is to build toy projects.
