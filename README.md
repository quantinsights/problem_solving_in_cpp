# Problem Solving in C++

> The real prize is the pleasure of finding things out, the kick in the discovery, the observation that other people use it. Those are the real things!

*Richard Feynman*

This is a small collection of routines and algorithms to solve selected problems in science and mathematics. The best way to learn anything is to build toy projects. 

## Modern C++ Programming

### C++ Basics

* [Hello World](cpp_programming/the_basics.cpp)
* [Basic types](cpp_programming/types.cpp)
* [Loop statements and risk-free bond mathematics](cpp_programming/statements.cpp)

## Computational Physics

### Harmonic Oscillators

* [Simple Harmonic Motion](computational_physics/harmonic_oscillators/simple_pendulum.cpp)

## Numerical Algorithms

### Python Notebooks

* [Systems of Linear Algebraic equations](numerical_algorithms/systems_of_linear_algebraic_equations/systems_of_linear_algebraic_equations.ipynb)

### Implementation

* [Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting](numerical_algorithms/systems_of_linear_algebraic_equations/gauss_elim.cpp)
* [LU Factorization](numerical_algorithms/systems_of_linear_algebraic_equations/ludcmp.cpp)
